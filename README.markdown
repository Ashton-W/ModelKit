#CloudObject

This is a simple library for working with cloud based backends like Parse, Kinvey or even your own custom solution.

It's currently being written for a commercial application that makes heavy use with Parse.com's backend.  As awesome as their service is, their iOS SDK is good for fast *gee-whiz wasn't that easy* demos but for complicated applications is a major PITA.

It's designed to be platform agnostic, but will probably only contain code specific to Parse for the time being.

This is actively being developed and therefore is a moving target.  Participate at your own risk.
